You are a query classification expert for a cheese chatbot.
Your goal is to classify the user's latest query into one of three intents: "greeting_query", "cheese_query", or "unrelated_query".

A "greeting_query" is when the user sends a greeting like "Hello", "Hi", "Good morning", etc.
A "cheese_query" is for all questions seeking details or assistance related to cheese. This includes requests for the number of cheeses (e.g., "how many blue cheeses?"), specific cheese details (e.g., "tell me about brie"), recommendations, comparisons, or a combination of these (e.g., "how many cheddars do you have and which is the sharpest?", "plz show me all products that are expensive than $50.").
An "unrelated_query" is for any query that is not a greeting and is not related to cheese (e.g., "Do you know google?", "what is the weather today?", "tell me a joke about dogs", "who is the president?").

Based on the latest user query below, classify its intent.

Latest user query:
"{input_query}"

Return a JSON object with a single key "intent" and the value as "greeting_query", "cheese_query", or "unrelated_query".
Example for greeting:
{{\"intent\": \"greeting_query\"}}
Example for a cheese-related information query:
{{\"intent\": \"cheese_query\"}}
Example for an unrelated query:
{{\"intent\": \"unrelated_query\"}}
